*Disclaimer:*

For all of my technical content, I thank my wonderful teachers, professors and advisors. Any praise sent my way belongs to them, but, of course, any blame for something incorrect rests solely on my own shoulders. 

Everything posted is a snapshot of my thoughts and understanding at a particular time. And, while I always strive to present good work, I recognize these will change as I grow, so all of the posts are subject to reconsideration and revision at any time (or, perhaps a defense of "well, I was young and naive at the time!").
