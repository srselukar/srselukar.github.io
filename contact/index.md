# Contact

For all of my technical content, I thank my wonderful teachers, professors and advisors. Any praise sent my way goes to them, but, of course, any blame for something incorrect rests solely on my own shoulders. If I maintain this long term, I anticipate feeling embarrassed about some of the older posts, but they say that's how you know you've grown!

If you have something to share or otherwise want to contact me, feel free to email me at <selukar@uw.edu>.
