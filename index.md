# Subodh Rajesh Selukar

I thought it was about time I added content to the internet rather than simply consuming it. I spend far too much time on Reddit and Netflix, while I kept ideas in the back of my head for things I might want to share with others.

I intend to use this website as a place to present various "tutorials" (more like "musings") on (bio)statistics but may also include more social/personal blog posts as well. I don't imagine that my technical posts will be revolutionary - my instructors have almost always done a superlative job at packaging information - but I want to share my views and learn along the way. 

Please use the links to the left to navigate to the content, and I hope you find something interesting here.
