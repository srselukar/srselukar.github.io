# Subodh Rajesh Selukar

I am a PhD student at the University of Washington's (UW) Department of Biostatistics studying, broadly, the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials.

For my dissertation, I had the simple goal of making sure that I would be as strong a clinical trials statistician as a newly minted PhD could be. This has led me to cobble together projects in the efficiency of platform trials, survival analysis of long-term survivors and sequential monitoring in N-of-1 trials. 

While my central passion is in clinical trials for human medicine, I am interested in many problems where a "statistical way of thinking" can be applied. For example, I have enjoyed working with the Mountain-Whisper-Light Statistics group in topics such as law and veterinary medicine. I hope to apply my knowledge and experience to help others even if it's something smaller like [deciding when to buy food on sale](/when-to-buy).

Pronouns: *He, him, his*

For a longer version of my journey into biostatistics, see [this post](/longer-about-me).

I  love to talk with people about their goals and ambitions - if you're reading this and are unsure about your place in (bio)statistics or wherever, then please do [reach out to me](/contact). I might not be able to help you directly, but I am delighted to be someone to bounce ideas off of.
