# Subodh Rajesh Selukar

I thought it was about time I added content to the internet rather than simply consuming it. 

I intend to use this website as a place to store various "tutorials" (more like "musings") on (bio)statistics but may also include more social/personal blog posts as well. Please use the links to the left to navigate to the content, and I hope you find something interesting here.
