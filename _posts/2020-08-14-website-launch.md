Took the first steps for building this website! Many thanks to GitHub, the Jekyll project, the creators of the minimal theme and also the authors of the tutorials I read: [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) and [Amanda Visconti](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages).
