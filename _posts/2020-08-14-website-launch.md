Took the first steps for building this website! Many thanks to GitHub, the Jekyll project, the creators of the minimal theme and also the authors of the tutorials I read: [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), [Sharath](https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/) and [Amanda Visconti](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages).

What finally pushed me to actually do this was a presentation by [John Graham Jr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngrahamcreative) during an internship at Amgen. His statement that "having no social media is a statement in itself" was particularly moving.
