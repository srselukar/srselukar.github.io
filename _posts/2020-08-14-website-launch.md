I thought it was about time I added content to the internet rather than simply consuming it. I spend far too much time on Reddit and Netflix, while I kept ideas in the back of my head for things I might want to share with others.

What finally pushed me to actually do this was a presentation by [John Graham Jr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngrahamcreative) during an internship at Amgen. His statement that "having no social media is a statement in itself" was particularly moving.

I intend to use this website as a place to present various “tutorials” (more like “musings”) on (bio)statistics but may also include more social/personal blog posts as well. I don’t imagine that my technical posts will be revolutionary - my instructors have almost always done a superlative job at packaging information - but I want to share my views and learn along the way.

Many thanks to [GitHub](https://github.com/srselukar), the [Jekyll project](https://jekyllrb.com/), the creators of the [minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) and also the authors of the tutorials I read: [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), [Sharath](https://blog.webjeda.com/jekyll-categories/) and [Amanda Visconti](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages).
