<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Washington‚Äôs (UW) Department of Biostatistics studying, broadly, the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials.</p>

<p>For my dissertation, I had the simple goal of making sure that I would be as strong a clinical trials statistician as a newly minted PhD could be. This has led me to cobble together projects in randomization and efficiency in platform trials, survival analysis of long-term survivors and sequential monitoring in N-of-1 trials.</p>

<p>While my central passion is in clinical trials for human medicine, I am interested in many problems where a ‚Äústatistical way of thinking‚Äù can be applied. For example, I have enjoyed working with the Mountain-Whisper-Light Statistics group in topics such as law and veterinary medicine.</p>

<p>I hope to apply my knowledge and experience to help others even if it‚Äôs something smaller like <a href="/when-to-buy">deciding when to buy food on sale</a>.</p>

<p>I  love to talk with people about their goals and ambitions - if you‚Äôre reading this and are unsure about your place in (bio)statistics or wherever, then please do <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a>. I might not be able to help you directly, but I am delighted to be someone to bounce ideas off of.</p>
