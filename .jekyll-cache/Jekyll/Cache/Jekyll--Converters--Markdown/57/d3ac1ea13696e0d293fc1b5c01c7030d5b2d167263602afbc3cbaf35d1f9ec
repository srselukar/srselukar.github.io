<p>I thought it was about time I added content to the internet rather than simply consuming it.</p>

<p>I intend to use this website as a place to store various “tutorials” on (bio)statistics but may also include more social/personal blog posts as well.</p>

<p>For all of my technical content, I thank my wonderful teachers, professors and advisors. Any praise sent my way goes to them, but, of course, any blame for something incorrect rests solely on my own shoulders. If I maintain this long term, I anticipate feeling embarrassed about some of the older posts, but they say that’s how you know you’ve grown!</p>

<p>If you are reading this (and aren’t me), then I hope you find something interesting here.</p>
