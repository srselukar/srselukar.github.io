<p>I am a PhD student at the University of Washington‚Äôs (UW) Department of Biostatistics studying, broadly, the design, conduct and analysis of clinical trials.</p>

<p>Pronouns: <em>He, his</em></p>

<h2 id="backstory-learning-about-biostatistics">Backstory: Learning about biostatistics</h2>

<p>Even though my father is a statistician, I didn‚Äôt know about biostatistics until partway through my sophomore year at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC). At the time, I had every intention of going to medical school and becoming a medical oncologist, but a college counselor recommended I look into biostatistics. I was well into my quantitative biology major at the time, but I thought that a biostatistics degree might help distinguish me from others in my medical school application.</p>

<p>I started my junior year without any second thoughts about medical school. I had agreed with two of my friends to take an MCAT class during the spring semester, but, as it turns out, by December I had to tell them how I had decided to change my entire life trajectory. (I still remember that moment vividly - we were walking in the school of public health campus back toward the main campus after class, and I was so nervous that they would be disappointed in me! But they took it very well.)</p>

<p>I realized that I lacked their raw passion for practicing medicine - while I had things like the shadowing hours and the coursework under my belt, I didn‚Äôt find myself excited to volunteer in the ER (like one of my friends) or take a gap year to volunteer in another country (like the other). Instead, I found myself increasingly drawn toward my biostatistics coursework. What really convinced me to pursue biostatistics as a career was a course project in which I read <em>Deadly Medicine</em> by Thomas Moore. To me, it really spoke to the importance of statisticians in medical science.</p>

<p>Even though I had decided not to pursue medicine itself, it was clear to me that I would want to study the closest thing (in my opinion) in biostatistics: clinical trials. The only thing left for me, at the time, was to decide where to apply for graduate school.</p>

<p>In my senior year, just before I applied, the Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM) took place in Seattle. I convinced my dad to go and let me tag along because I had heard great things about the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. After speaking with some professors and students there, I was pretty convinced that it was my dream school. The department is known for being a very rigorous program with a focus on ensuring its students have an excellent theoretical foundation - even though I wanted to be an applied statistician in clinical trials, it seemed practical to start my career with as much theory as I could, rather than learn more of it on my own.</p>

<p>When I applied, I fully expected to be rejected: browsing the students‚Äô pages at the time, I did not feel like I stacked up at all. Somehow, however, the admissions committee slipped my application into the ‚ÄúAcceptances‚Äù pile. I was also accepted to UNC‚Äôs Biostatistics program, but I thought this was my chance to move out on my own and experience the big city life (I grew up in North Carolina - visiting UNC was a frequent trip when we had guests). In addition, I had heard a rumor that departments preferred to hire new professors from outside of their PhD program, and in the back of my head, I maintained the hope that I‚Äôd come back to live in Chapel Hill. (Who knows if that‚Äôs what is in store for me!)</p>

<p>Excited, but with a heavy heart for leaving UNC, I moved to Seattle in Summer 2016. (My girlfriend and I drove across the country and visited many national parks along the way - definitely a life-changing experience that I highly recommend, if possible!)</p>

<h2 id="a-short-overview-of-graduate-school">A short overview of graduate school</h2>
<p>Quickly after starting, I learned what ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù coursework meant: it was really hard.</p>

<p>In my first-year statistical theory sequence, it felt like the professor was only teaching the class to the students who had already taken a class with the course textbook; the rest of us just had to catch up. It seemed as if in every lecture he would use the word ‚Äúrecall‚Äù when describing a completely new concept.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the other first-year biostatistics students and I commiserated and survived. The second year felt a bit better: while the classes were even more difficult, it felt as if everyone in the class was on the same page. By some miracle, I even managed to cap the second year by passing both of the qualifying exams: it was a huge relief to be able to continue onto the dissertation phase of the PhD.</p>

<p>My third year also included the opportunity to take the applied statistics that I had been excited to take since undergrad. It was an absolute honor, in particular, to take a class in clinical trials from a giant in the field like Tom Fleming (incidentally, I was even more lucky to TA for him the following year!). The concepts were familiar, but hearing them from him was illuminating.</p>

<p>My fourth year passed in a complete blur. I no longer needed to take classes, so my academic time was spent solely on research and TA work. Outside of academics, I also had the opportunity to do consulting: as an independent consultant, I helped an orthodontics student with a data analysis for his thesis, and I also joined Nayak Polissar‚Äôs group of The Mountain-Whisper-Light Statistics to work on a variety of projects.</p>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>
<p>At the time of writing this, it is Summer 2020, and I am doing a virtual internship at Amgen, while the world is being ravaged by Covid-19.</p>

<p>In my internship, I have the privilege to work on simulation-based design considerations for confirmatory clinical trials. While I did (perhaps, arrogantly) believe I could do it, I did not expect to be given an opportunity like this - I felt this was something left to the senior statisticians with years of experience under their belts.</p>

<p>Working at Amgen in simulation-based design has been an amazing experience because it takes my interest in the design of clinical trials and additionally allows for enormous creativity. With simulations, it really is a matter of ‚Äúif you can imagine it, you can do it‚Äù (given enough wrestling of the code‚Ä¶).</p>

<p>After my internship ends in September, I will return to my dissertation work with the hope of graduating in Summer/early Fall 2021 and proceeding into a career (of course, planning around Covid may be a fool‚Äôs errand).</p>

<p>As someone interested in being a clinical trials statistician, I am blessed to have a wide variety of options spanning academia, government and industry. In any of those areas, I am confident I can realize my hopes of growing into a thoughtful and capable leader in clinical trials statistics.</p>
