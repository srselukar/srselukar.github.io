I"†<p>I thought it was about time I added content to the internet rather than simply consuming it. I spend far too much time on Reddit and Netflix, while I kept ideas in the back of my head for things I might want to share with others.</p>

<p>What finally pushed me to actually do this was a presentation by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngrahamcreative">John Graham Jr.</a> during an internship at Amgen. His statement that ‚Äúhaving no social media is a statement in itself‚Äù was particularly moving.</p>

<p>I intend to use this website as a place to present various ‚Äútutorials‚Äù (more like ‚Äúmusings‚Äù) on (bio)statistics but may also include more social/personal blog posts as well. I don‚Äôt imagine that my technical posts will be revolutionary - my instructors have almost always done a superlative job at packaging information - but I want to share my views and learn along the way.</p>
