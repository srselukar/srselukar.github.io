<p>For all of my technical content, I thank my wonderful teachers, professors and advisors. Any praise sent my way belongs to them, but, of course, any blame for something incorrect rests solely on my own shoulders.</p>

<p>Everything posted is a snapshot of my thoughts and understanding at a particular time. And, while I always strive to present good work, I recognize these will change as I grow, so all of the posts are subject to reconsideration and revision at any time (or, perhaps a defense of “well, I was young and naive at the time!”).</p>
